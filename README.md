# FilmVerse_Web
This is a project of the university. The main idea of this project is do a web movie reviews, this web has two views, the view of an administrador and the view of one common user. The administrador can edit, add and delete movies, and the common user only can comment one movie that is in the system. I used several technologies for do this project, I used MongoDB for the data base, I use NodeJS for the backend and some dependencies like: bcrypt, cors, dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, mongoose and nodemon. The other main idea is the use of API's thanks the use of MongoDB. About lenguages, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for some interactions on the page and for manipulate the API.
